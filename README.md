 The Broken Server Code
========================

 You have been handed an existing codebase with reported issues.
It is supposed to be following reasonable practices and appears to be pretty
simple, but customers are complaining that certain operations are failing
or not functioning as expected.

 Unfortunately there are no tests in the codebase.
 Commit history is useless. JavaDocs are vague at best.
 
 Your goal is to review this code, ensure the code builds and review the code
and fix as many mistakes, issues or omissions as you can find to ensure that
what the code does follows reasonable API practices and matches comments that
have been left in the code (in case of doubt - consider comments to be the
only specification you have got).

 It is up to you to choose approach and tooling you will use for this task,
however you are not allowed to change public API mappings and signatures
as they will be used to validate your progress.

 You are not expected to spot and fix all issues, however the more you do,
the better your score in this task will be. This exercise should not take
you more than a couple of hours.

 Good luck!
